# angular2-webpack-aspnetcoreProject template for angular2 applications built with webpack, tested with karma and protractor and hosted with ASP.NET CoreThe ASP.NET Core parts are completely optional and only serve the purpose of showcasing how this type of single page application can get hosted and deployed by an ASP.NET Core application. However, this project template is 100% functional also when- Using only the parts in the "Frontend" subfolder- Omitting the following ASP.NET specific parts  - Frontend.xproj  - Program.cs  - Startup.cs  - project.json  - web.config  - Properties/# Getting started- Make sure you have the latest node & npm installed- Clone this repository- Navigate into the cloned folders "Frontend" subfolder- npm install- npm run dev- Open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/wwwroot/Index.html in a browser- The application should be shown# Preconfigured commands- "npm run build" builds the application in release mode, minifying output and without sourcemaps, placing output in the "wwwroot" subfolder- "npm run dev" starts the webpack dev server with the application compiled with debug-friendly options. Enables debugging TypeScript source code within the browser, and reloads the app on every source file change.- "npm run test" runs the unit tests and produces code coverage results in html and cobertura format in the "Frontend/test/unit/coverage" subfolder- "npm run test-dev" runs the unit tests, while watching for source or test file changes, re-running the tests automatically. Each re-run also produces new code coverage results- "npm run test-debug" runs the unit tests without producing code coverage results, but starting them in Chrome with source-mapping enabled, so you can easily debug your unit tests.- "npm run e2e" runs the protractor UI tests  - The protractor tests assume the application is running on http://localhost:50775, not just in the webpack dev server. To host the app there, run "dotnet restore" and "dotnet run" in the "Frontend" folder
